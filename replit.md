# Dashboard · Gestión de Proyectos

## Overview
This is a Project Management Dashboard (in Spanish) that provides a comprehensive view of project tasks, deadlines, and status tracking. The application connects to Google Sheets for data and provides interactive filtering, status editing, and reporting capabilities.

## Project Type
Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript website with:
- Vanilla JavaScript (no framework)
- External CDN libraries: PapaParse (CSV parsing), Chart.js (visualizations)
- Google Sheets integration for data storage
- Apps Script integration for updates

## Key Features
1. **Cascading Filters**: Type, Client, Project, Status, Owner - filters update dynamically based on previous selections
2. **Executive Summary**: KPI dashboard with option to include/exclude finished tasks
3. **Status Breakdown**: Accordion view showing:
   - Finished tasks (all tasks with "Finalizado" status)
   - Overdue tasks (tasks with deadline before yesterday and not finished)
   - Tasks due within 21 days
   - Tasks due in 3+ weeks
4. **Status Editing**: Edit task status directly in the dashboard with save/discard functionality
5. **Data Refresh**: Pull latest data from Google Sheets
6. **Share Links**: Generate filtered URLs with email-based access control
7. **Password Protection**: Access key "Tomi.2016" required

## Configuration
The application is configured via `data/config.js`:
- `csvUrl`: Published Google Sheets CSV endpoint
- `gsUpdateUrl`: Apps Script Web App URL for saving status changes
- `columns`: Column name mappings
- `estatusOptions`: Available status values

## Data Integration
- **Data Source**: Google Sheets (published as CSV)
- **Updates**: Via Apps Script Web App (POST requests)
  - Apps Script handles updates for: Tareas, Owner, Deadline, Estatus
  - Format: `{ changes: [{ id, changes: { fieldName: newValue } }] }`
  - See `INSTRUCCIONES_APPS_SCRIPT.md` for setup instructions
- **Automated Emails**: Apps Script triggers on Mon/Wed/Fri at 8:00 AM (America/Santiago timezone)

## Access Control
1. **Password Access**: Default password "Tomi.2016"
2. **Shared Links**: URL parameters with email validation
   - Format: `?cliente=<Client>&proyecto=<Project>&share=1&email=<email>`
   - Access granted if email exists in the Email column for that Client/Project
